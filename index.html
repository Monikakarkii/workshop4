    <p> PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS or more commonly called 'PUBG' is a multi-verse franchise that branches from competitive survival shooters (PUBG) to survival horror (The Callisto Protocol) video game titles. The base lore of PUBG is based around a fictional island called 'Erangel' where citizens take part in a Battle Royale, 1 vs 100 or squad vs squad which players are pitted against one another in a fight for survival.PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people.</p>
